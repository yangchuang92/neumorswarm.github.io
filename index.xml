      <description>SOCIAL PLACE CELLS For social animals, such as bats and rats, tracking the position of a conspecific is important for social interactions such as observational learning. Much previous research has described how hippocampal place cells encode one&amp;rsquo;s own spatial location; however, the neuronal basis for encoding the position of another is unknown. Two new papers(Danjo et al., Omer et al.) identify so-called social place cells : neurons in the dorsal CA1 region (dCA1) of the hippocampus in bats and in rats that encode the position of an observed conspecific.</description>

      <description>NeuromorphicSWARM: Brain-inspired Swarm Perception, Awareness and Navigation for Autonomous Collective Robots  For social animals, such as bats and rats, as well as knowing self location, being able to recognize the position of others in space is a crucial skill for purposes of hunting, escaping a predator, social interactions, observational learning, etc. Decades of research on the mammalian hippocampal formation has revealed a set of spatial neurons that represent self-position and orientation, including place cells, grid cells, head-direction cells, and border/boundary cells.</description>
